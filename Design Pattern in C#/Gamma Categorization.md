## Creation patterns
- Deal with the creation (construction) of an objects.
- Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc..)
- Wholesale(single statemanet) vs piecewise (step-by-step)

## Structural patterns
- Concern with the structure (e.g. class member)
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class's interface
- Stress the importance of good API design
## Behavior patterns
- They are all different; no central theme
