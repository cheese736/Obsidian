AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. Basically it’s more a pattern than anything else. You have a page, that asynchronously fetches data without reloading the page.

>It is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with servers in a nutshell. It can send and receive data in a variety of formats such as JSON, XML, HTML, and text files.

There are **many** AJAX wrappers and **modules.** If you want to know more about AJAX, try the old **method** `**XMLHttpRequest**` .The **Fetch API, is a** newer and convenient way **to make Ajax** calls.

There are many frameworks that have already wrapped AJAX codes into short snippets. One example would be `Axios` Js.

>**Ajax is gradually being replaced by functions within JavaScript frameworks and the official Fetch API Standard**.
